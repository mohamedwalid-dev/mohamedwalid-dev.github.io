Data is powerful, but only when presented the right way. The type of chart you choose can make or break how effectively your audience understands your message.

Here’s a quick guide to chart selection based on the story you want to tell:

Bar Chart → Best for comparing quantities across categories (e.g., product sales).

Line Chart → Perfect for showing trends over time (e.g., website traffic growth).

Pie Chart → Useful to highlight proportions and percentages (e.g., budget breakdown).

Scatter Plot → Great for representing relationships between variables (e.g., marketing spend vs ROI).

Histogram → Ideal for visualizing data distribution (e.g., age distribution of survey respondents).

Radar Chart → Compare multiple categories across dimensions (e.g., product performance).

Map → Show geospatial data (e.g., regional sales performance).

Heatmap → Spot patterns in large datasets (e.g., customer activity hotspots).

Bubble Chart → Display three-dimensional data (e.g., revenue, cost, profit).

Donut Chart → Emphasize specific parts of a whole (e.g., marketing spend distribution).

✨ Choosing the right chart is not just about visuals—it’s about clarity, impact, and storytelling.
